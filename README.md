# Project Title: Crime rate Analysis in Toronto by Neighbourhoods 



## Background Story: 

Team: Data Analytics team in DATAHOLICS Inc. - an emerging startup in Toronto

Client: SafeNet Insurance Corp. -  our first client

Goal: Provide an exploratory analysis of historic crime data in the different Neighborhoods of Toronto 

Main Deliverable: Qualitative analysis and quantified risk factors for location and other circumstantial categories

##	Project Description / Outline

Exploratory analysis for MCI crime categories for Toronto's Neighbourhoods between 2015 - 2021.

## Research questions to Answer

Does criminal activity vary significantly between different Neighborhoods in Toronto?

Is there a historic trend for criminal activity for the City of Toronto and for each Neighborhood?

How does the crime rate change during seasons?

How does the crime rate change during weekdays or weekends?

How does the crime rate change during day/night?

How does the crime rate change vs premises type?

Does the type of criminal activity vary significantly?

## Findings:

### Location:

1. Criminal Activity Varies Significantly between Toronto’s Neighborhoods

2. There is no clear overall trend for criminal activity for the past 7 years

3. There are specific neighborhoods that showed an increase in criminal activity correlated to time

### Categorical:

1. All categories were statistically significant

2. Variation between categories was significant for the Premise type and time of day

3. Variation was less significant for the seasonal and weekend/weekday parameters

4. More than 50% of criminal activity was attributed to a single category


## Summary and Results:

1. The safest areas in GTA are: Pleasant View, Centennial Scarborough, Mount Pleasant East, Yonge St.Clair and Steels. They are locations with the lowest risk factors, which indicates that customers who are willing to open a business in these areas are charged with the least amount of premiums. 

2. Five least safe areas are: Moss Park, Bay Street Corridor, Church-Yonge Corridor, Kensington-China Town and University), indicating high risk factors.

3. Different types of crime in GTA are (In order from highest to lowest) Assualt, Break and Enter, Auto Theft and Theft Over $5000.

4. Most crimes occur in the evening (6.00pm to 12.00am) and the least crimes occur in the morning (6.00am to 12.00pm)

5. Different types of crime in GTA are (In order from highest to lowest) Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft and Theft Over $5000.

5. Crime rate doesnt show any significant changes during seasons. 

6. Crime rate doesnt show any significant changes during weekdays or weekends.

7. Crime rate shows that most crimes happen during the evening and least happen in the morning. Time of day can be accounted for when calculating premium. 

8. The regression model of crime rates in Toronto shows a gradual increase annually, but with an r-squared value of 0.12, which shows that there is not strong correlation with time.

9. Correlation with time varies between specific neighbourhoods.
